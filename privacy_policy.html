    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
        The Butler Group LLC respects your privacy.
        In the course of providing our services we sometimes collect, store, and use your personal and business
        information for specifically defined purposes.
        We use your information to support and enhance our relationship with you, to provide service and support, and to
        share product, service, and company news and offerings with you.
        Under no circumstances do we sell your information to a third party.
        We do however reserve the right to share your information outside the company as required by specific law, or if
        compelled to do so by a subpoena.
        If it is deemed necessary to share your information with a third party, we will only do so with your express
        written consent, and then only with partners who are also legally bound to The Butler Group LLC to protect your
        privacy and data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Agents, employees, or contractors of The Butler Group LLC who have access to your information are required to
        keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are
        performing for The Butler Group LLC.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Butler Group LLC may be required to disclose your information in connection with law enforcement, fraud
        prevention, government regulation, or other legal action, or if The Butler Group LLC reasonably believes it is
        necessary to do so to protect itself, its customers, or the public.
